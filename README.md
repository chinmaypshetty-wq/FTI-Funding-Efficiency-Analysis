# Future Technologies Institute (FTI) Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the operational and financial performance of the Future Technologies Institute (FTI). Currently operating at a **$36 million annual loss**, the institute requires a strategic restructure. Using **Tableau**, this analysis explores the correlation between funding allocation, researcher seniority, and academic output to identify inefficiencies and propose cost-saving measures.

* **Tool:** Tableau (packaged workbook included)
* **Context:** Academic/Research Operations Analysis
* **Files:** [View Strategic Report](./FTI_Strategic_Report.pdf) | [Download Tableau Workbook](./FTI_Dashboard_CS.twbx)

## Business Problem
FTI has a total expenditure of **$116 million** against a total income of **$80 million**. The objective of this analysis is to identify which research levels and departments are underperforming and to provide data-driven recommendations to reduce the deficit.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed significant imbalances in staffing efficiency and funding distribution:

* **Staffing Inefficiency:** Level A researchers (Post-docs) comprise the majority of the workforce yet generate the least amount of external funding. Conversely, Level E researchers (Professors) are the minority but are the most efficient in securing grants.
* **Funding vs. Output:** There is a strong positive correlation between funding received and the number of publications produced. However, the current staffing model does not align with this, as high-cost, low-yield teams are over-represented.
* **Departmental Skew:** The Health & Medical Sciences sector receives the highest proportion of funding, while other sectors struggle to generate comparable ROI.

## Strategic Recommendations
Based on the data visualization and statistical review, the following actions are proposed:
1.  **Workforce Restructuring:** Reduce the reliance on Level A researchers and shift the hiring focus toward Level C and E researchers who demonstrate higher funding efficiency.
2.  **Output-Based Funding:** Reallocate internal budgets to prioritize departments with high publication-to-funding ratios.
3.  **Team Optimization:** Decrease the size of underperforming research teams to lower overhead costs while maintaining output quality.

## Dashboard Visualizations
This repository includes a Tableau Packaged Workbook (`.twbx`) containing:
* **Funding Analysis:** Scatter plots correlating grant income with citation counts.
* **Staffing Breakdown:** Bar charts visualizing the distribution of researchers by Level (A-E) and their respective costs.
* **Sector Performance:** Comparative analysis of Health, Engineering, and Science outputs.
